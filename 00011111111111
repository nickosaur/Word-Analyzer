There is no worse way to shop than on your smartphone.

I almost never do it, and I’m surprised that so many others do. Navigating
online shops is a chore. Images rarely zoom or scroll correctly. It’s hard to
compare one item to another. Large arrow icons block out parts of clothing or
furniture, if they appear at all. Checkout functions aren’t well-suited to touch
screens either; typing your address and credit card number into a new shop is
miserable.

There are a number of ways user experience designers and hardware developers
could make all of this a lot easier. But there’s a benefit to all these annoying
barriers. Research shows we’re likely to make impulse purchases on our phones — 
things that are unnecessary and probably a waste of money. If you can’t even get
the mobile site to work for whatever cute little brand you’re looking to drop a
couple of hundred dollars on, you probably just saved some dough that’s better
spent elsewhere.

According to research on consumers’ mobile shopping behavior, there are two
types of purchases people tend to make on their mobile devices: “hedonic
purchases” and “habitual purchases.” A hedonic purchase could be a pair of
stylish shoes that you buy on a whim from an Instagram ad — something you want
very much, not something that you need.
